# TOTD Discord Bot

This is a Discord bot for displaying the daily [Trackmania](https://www.trackmania.com/) Track of the Day (and maybe more in the future).

Disclaimer: This bot uses undocumented APIs (and libraries based on them), so it may break at any time - potentially indefinitely if Nadeo/Ubisoft decide to close off those APIs.

Extra disclaimer: This is just a pet project I'm working on for fun (and to learn a bit about Discord bots) - don't expect super-tidy code or great documentation. If you encounter any issues with it, either open an issue on Github or talk to me on Discord (tooInfinite#5113).

Current features:

- Manual TOTD post
- Scheduled TOTD post every day just after it's been released
- Configuration commands to store where the scheduled posts should be sent
- Help command

## Setup/Development üíª

The bot is written in Node.js - so you'll need to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), which automatically comes with NPM, the default package manager.

To run it, just run an `npm i` and an `npm start`. Make sure you've added a `.env` file (see the template for the format).
I suggest not using your main UPlay/Ubisoft Connect account - it doesn't have to own the game, so you can just create a new one for this bot.

Every commit on `main` triggers an update to the live version of the bot running on a Heroku dyno.

## Planned Features/TODOs üìã

- Find better voting emojis - the current ones are just screenshots from TMNF.
- Add a short info message when joining a new server.
- More data (currently uses TM and TMX when available) - there's probably more interesting metadata the bot could display.
  - How many TOTDs did the author have before?
  - Current WR (but I guess that's not very useful when it gets TOTD)
  - Summary of the last TOTD with top 5 (incl. player links to tm.io and maybe some aggregate data like player numbers)
- Some general restructuring of the code and some more documentation of the existing functionality.
- Documentation for the environment variable configuration.

## Special Thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è

Thanks go to:

- The [TMX](https://trackmania.exchange/) team for their platform and well-documented API.
- Miss (@codecat) for her work on [trackmania.io](https://trackmania.io).
- @breeku for creating [a neat wrapper](https://github.com/breeku/trackmania-api-node) around a bunch of reverse-engineered Nadeo APIs (let's hope they don't break).
