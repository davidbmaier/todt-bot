# TOTD Discord Bot

This is a Discord bot for displaying the daily [Trackmania](https://www.trackmania.com/) Track of the Day (and maybe more in the future).

**Disclaimer:** This bot uses undocumented APIs (and libraries based on them), so it may break at any time - potentially indefinitely if Nadeo/Ubisoft decide to close off those APIs.

**Extra disclaimer:** This is just a pet project I'm working on for fun (and to learn a bit about Discord bots) - don't expect super-tidy code or great documentation. If you encounter any issues with it, either open an issue on Github or talk to me on Discord (tooInfinite#5113).

## What can this bot do? ü§ñ

**Public invite link:** [Click here!](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=807920588738920468&permissions=387136&scope=bot)

Use at your own risk - the bot is in development and may break from time to time.

- `!totd today` - Prints the current TOTD information to the current channel.
- `!totd enable` - Stores the current channel to the list the daily scheduled TOTD post gets sent to. One channel per server. Admin only.
- `!totd disable` - Removes the current channel from the list the scheduled TOTD post gets sent to. Admin only.
- `!totd help` - Displays some info about the bot.

## Setup/Development üíª

The bot is written in Node.js - so you'll need to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), which automatically comes with NPM, the default package manager.

To run it, just run an `npm i` and an `npm start`. Make sure you've added a `.env` file (see the template for the format).

- `DISCORD_TOKEN` is the Discord bot's auth token (see any tutorial for more info).
- `USER_LOGIN` is your UPlay/Ubisoft Connect credentials - I suggest not using your main account. It doesn't have to own the game, so you can just create a new one for this bot.
- `DEPLOY_MODE` should only be `prod` if it's supposed to be live. Everything else is interpreted as a development mode (which means that all commands will be prefixed with `dev` - e.g. `!devtotd today`).
- `REDIS_URL` is a Redis database - it's required for the scheduled messages. If you're using an insecure instance for local development, you can omit the auth part.
- `ADMIN_TAG` is the Discord tag of the bot admin - mainly used for undocumented debug commands that only they should be allowed to run.

Every commit on `main` triggers an update to the live version of the bot running on a Heroku dyno.

## Planned Features/TODOs üìã

- Find better voting emojis - the current ones are just screenshots from TMNF.
- Add a short info message when joining a new server (if there's a reliable way to find the "main" channel).
- Cache TOTD data once per day.
- More data (currently uses TM and TMX when available) - there's probably more interesting metadata the bot could display.
  - How many TOTDs did the author have before?
  - Current WR (but I guess that's not very useful when it gets TOTD)
  - Summary of the last TOTD with top 5 (incl. player links to tm.io and maybe some aggregate data like player numbers)
- Some general restructuring of the code and some more documentation of the existing functionality.

## Special Thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è

Thanks go to:

- The [TMX](https://trackmania.exchange/) team for their platform and well-documented API.
- Miss ([@codecat](https://github.com/codecat)) for her work on [trackmania.io](https://trackmania.io).
- [@breeku](https://github.com/breeku) for creating [a neat wrapper](https://github.com/breeku/trackmania-api-node) around a bunch of reverse-engineered Nadeo APIs (let's hope they don't break).
